'''Pseudo code is not actual code; instead, it is a detailed yet informal description of 
what a computer program or algorithm must do. It is intended for human reading 
rather than machine reading. Therefore, it is easier for people to understand than 
conventional programming language code. Pseudo code does not need to obey 
any specific syntax rules, unlike conventional programming languages. Hence it 
can be understood by any programmer, irrespective of the programming 
languages they're familiar with. 

As a programmer, pseudo code will help you better understand how to implement
an algorithm, especially if it is un familiar to you. You can then translate your pseudo 
code in to your chosen programming language. 

Pseudo code is easy to write and understand, even if you have no programming 
experience. You simply need to write down a logical breakdown of what you want 
your program to do. Therefore, It is a good tool to use in business to discuss, 
analyse, and agree on a program's design with a team of programmers, users, and 
clients before coding the solution.'''
